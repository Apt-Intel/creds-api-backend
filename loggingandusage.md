# Implementation Plan for Request Logging and Usage-based Tracking

## 1. Database Schema Design

- Design schema for request logs (API key, IP, timestamp, endpoint, status, response time, etc.)
- Update ApiKey model with usage tracking fields (daily/monthly usage, limits)

## 2. Database Setup

- Create new table/collection for request logs
- Modify ApiKey table to include new usage tracking fields

## 3. Request Logging Middleware

- Create `requestLoggingMiddleware.js`
- Implement asynchronous logging using a queue system (e.g., Bull)
- Capture request details (API key, IP, timestamp, endpoint, etc.)

## 4. Usage Tracking Service

- Create `usageTrackingService.js`
- Implement methods to update and retrieve usage statistics
- Add functions to check if usage limits are exceeded

## 5. Update Rate Limiting Middleware

- Modify `complexRateLimitMiddleware.js`
- Integrate with Usage Tracking Service
- Implement both short-term and long-term (usage-based) rate limiting

## 6. Asynchronous Processing

- Set up worker process for handling logging and usage updates
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms

## 7. API Key Management Updates

- Update `generateApiKey` and `updateApiKeyStatus` in `apiKeyUtils.js`
- Include usage limits in API key generation and updates
- Add endpoints for retrieving usage statistics

## 8. Admin Dashboard Routes

- Create new routes for viewing logs and usage statistics
- Implement functionality to adjust usage limits for API keys

## 9. Periodic Reset Mechanism

- Implement a scheduled task to reset usage counters (daily/monthly)
- Ensure fault tolerance in the reset process

## 10. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement comprehensive error handling in new components
- Set up alerts for critical errors or unusual usage patterns

## 11. Performance Optimization

- Implement caching for frequently accessed usage data
- Optimize database queries for log retrieval

## 12. Testing

- Develop unit tests for new components
- Create integration tests
- Perform load testing

## 13. Documentation

- Update API documentation with new usage limits and logging details
- Create internal documentation for new systems

## 14. Monitoring and Analytics

- Set up monitoring for logging and usage tracking systems
- Create dashboards for visualizing usage patterns and system health

## 15. Gradual Rollout

- Plan phased rollout of new features
- Implement feature flags for easy enabling/disabling

## 16. Security Review

- Conduct security review of new logging and tracking systems
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
