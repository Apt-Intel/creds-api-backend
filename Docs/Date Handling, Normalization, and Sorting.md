### Date Handling and Sorting

#### Current Implementation (After Date Compromised Field)

The API now uses the "Date Compromised" field for all date-based sorting operations. This field is stored in a standardized format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) in the database, eliminating the need for runtime date normalization.

##### Current Data Flow

1. Client makes request with sort parameters
2. Controller fetches data with database-level sorting
3. Sorted data is paginated and returned

##### Sorting Implementation

Sorting is performed at the database level using:

- "Date Compromised" (when sortby=date_compromised)
- "Date" (when sortby=date_uploaded)

#### Historical Implementation (Archived)

Previously, the API used a middleware-based approach for date normalization and sorting:

##### Previous Data Flow

1. Controller fetched raw data
2. dateNormalizationMiddleware normalized "Log date" fields
3. sortingMiddleware sorted the normalized data
4. Sorted data was paginated and returned

##### Archived Components

The following components have been archived as they're no longer needed:

1. `dateNormalizationMiddleware`: Normalized "Log date" fields
2. `dateService`: Provided date parsing and normalization utilities
3. Date format logging system for tracking new date formats

These components are now archived in `scripts/Archived/` for historical reference.

#### Files to Delete

The following files can be safely deleted as they're no longer used:

1. Core Files:

```
middlewares/dateNormalizationMiddleware.js
services/dateService.js
```

2. Test Files:

```
__tests__/dateService.test.js
```

3. Log Files:

```
logs/new_date_formats/new_date_formats.log
```

4. Documentation Updates:

- Remove date normalization references from API documentation
- Update middleware chain documentation

#### Migration Summary

Before:

```javascript
// Previous implementation
router.get(
  "/endpoint",
  controller,
  dateNormalizationMiddleware, // Normalized "Log date"
  sortingMiddleware, // Sorted normalized dates
  sendResponseMiddleware
);
```

After:

```javascript
// Current implementation
router.get(
  "/endpoint",
  controller, // Includes DB-level sorting using "Date Compromised"
  sortingMiddleware, // Only validates sort parameters
  sendResponseMiddleware
);
```

The change from middleware-based date handling to database-level sorting using a standardized date field has:

- Improved performance by eliminating runtime date normalization
- Simplified the middleware chain
- Reduced complexity in date handling logic
- Provided consistent and reliable date sorting
