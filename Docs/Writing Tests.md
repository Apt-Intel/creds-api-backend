# Writing Tests

## Overview

This document outlines the standards and guidelines for writing, organizing, and maintaining tests in the codebase. Adhering to these practices ensures code reliability, facilitates collaboration, and streamlines the development process.

## Directory Structure

```

├── __tests__/           # Unit and integration tests
│   ├── dateService.test.js
│   ├── documentRedesignDomainMiddleware.test.js
│   └── loginController.test.js
├── tests/
│   ├── performance/     # Performance tests
│   │   └── loadTest.js
│   └── e2e/            # End-to-end tests
├── scripts/            # Manual test scripts
└── all other files     # Application source code
```

## Test Types

1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual units of code (functions, methods).
2. **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different modules or components.
3. **Performance Tests:** Assess the application's performance under load.
4. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Test the complete application flow.
5. **Manual Test Scripts:** Utility scripts for ad-hoc testing.

## Naming Conventions

- **Test Files:** Use the format `<module>.test.js`.
- **Test Suites:** Use `describe` blocks with clear and descriptive names.
- **Test Cases:** Use `it` or `test` blocks with statements that express the expected behavior.

## Writing Tests with Jest

### Setup

- Ensure Jest is installed as a development dependency.
- Configure Jest in `package.json` or use a `jest.config.js` file if custom configuration is needed.

### Example Test File

```javascript
// __tests__/exampleModule.test.js

const { functionToTest } = require("../src/exampleModule");

describe("Example Module", () => {
  it("should perform the expected behavior when condition is met", () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = "test input";
    const expectedOutput = "expected output";

    // Act
    const result = functionToTest(input);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expectedOutput);
  });
  // Additional test cases...
});
```

### Guidelines

- **Arrange, Act, Assert Pattern:** Structure tests clearly to improve readability.
- **Isolate Tests:** Use mocking to isolate the unit under test.
- **Avoid Side Effects:** Tests should not modify global state or interfere with each other.
- **Clean Up:** Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to set up and tear down test environments.

## Running Tests

Add the following scripts to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest --coverage",
  "test:unit": "jest __tests__",
  "test:performance": "node tests/performance/loadTest.js"
}
```

- **Run All Tests:** `npm test`
- **Run Unit Tests Only:** `npm run test:unit`
- **Run Performance Tests:** `npm run test:performance`

## Continuous Integration

- Configure CI pipelines to run tests on each commit or pull request.
- Set up code coverage thresholds and enforce them in CI.
- Integrate static code analysis tools where appropriate.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Tests Up-to-Date:** Update tests when code changes.
- **Focus on Edge Cases:** Write tests for both expected and unexpected inputs.
- **Document Test Cases:** Use comments if the test logic is not immediately clear.
- **Review and Refactor:** Regularly review tests to improve clarity and coverage.

By following these guidelines, developers can ensure that tests are consistently written and maintained, leading to a more robust and reliable application.

---

**Moving Forward**

- **Remove** redundant scripts if their functionality is covered by automated tests.
- **Place** any necessary manual scripts in the `scripts/` directory for clarity.
- **Ensure** all new tests adhere to the standards outlined in this documentation.
